## Verification questions

Please use the `RpnCalc` program to answer these questions:

1. How many operations are required to evaluate this expression for the surface area of a
   dodecahedron?  (Note: `edgeLength` is a parameter of the formula and should be parsed as a
   variable.)
   `3 25 10 5 sqrt() * + sqrt() * edgeLength 2 ^ *`

   Answer: 7

2. How many operations are required to evaluate the optimized form of that expression?

   Answer: 2

## Reflection questions

1. What part of the assignment did you find the trickiest to understand or get working?
   Was there a particular insight or diagnostic technique that lead to a breakthrough?

   Answer: The CsvEvaluator was particularly difficult for us because there was a lot of things to
   consider. It took us a lot of time to think things through. Especially the recursion that the
   function colToLetters function. Specifically the addition of adding letters and numbers. The way
   we worked through our road blocks was drawing out the methods and using print statements to see
   what we were actually inputting.
